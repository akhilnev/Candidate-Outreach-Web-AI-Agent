SUBJECT LINE: Intro from Mercor

Hey {name},

I hope you're well! My name is Akhilesh, and I'm an undergrad at Iowa State. Iâ€™m on the growth team at Mercor, a startup based in San Francisco. 

We hire PhDs to provide feedback to AI models for top AI labs and have paid over $10M to people on our platform. We're launching a part-time project with CS/AI/ML PhDs and PhD candidates this spring for a leading AI lab, and are paying participants $50-100 per hour.

Would you be interested in joining?

Best,
Akhilesh
